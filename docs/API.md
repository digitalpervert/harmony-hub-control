# Local Control API

The web UI intentionally has no HTTP authentication. Run it only on a trusted
LAN or behind your own access controls.

All write endpoints accept `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies. JSON
responses use `ok: true` on success and `ok: false` with `error` on failure.

## Inventory

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/inventory"
```

Returns hub limits, configured devices, command names, keycode/raw flags, and
local command counts.

List runnable commands for one device:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/device-commands?deviceId=<device-id>"
```

## IR Control

Send one saved command:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/ir-send" -Method Post -Body @{
  deviceId = "<device-id>"
  command  = "PowerOff"
}
```

Send a cancellable batch:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/ir-batch-send" -Method Post -Body @{
  deviceId = "<device-id>"
  commands = "PowerOff`nInputHdmi1"
  delayMs  = "80"
  dryRun   = "0"
  runId    = "example-run-1"
}
```

The response includes `sent`, `attempted`, `skipped`, `failed`, `elapsedMs`, and
`lastReply`. `failed` is incremented when the hub rejects a stored command, so
large sweeps can keep going while still showing unsupported names clearly.

Cancel a running batch:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/ir-cancel" -Method Post -Body @{
  runId = "example-run-1"
}
```

Create or reuse the temporary IR sweep target:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/ir-lab-target" -Method Post
```

Import commands from database-converted lines:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/irdb-import" -Method Post -Body @{
  deviceId = "<device-id>"
  payload  = "PowerOff|G:Toshiba 32 Bit:(0xE0E040BF)(Repeat)():3"
}
```

Raw timing imports use:

```text
CommandName|raw|F9470P20D0S1068...
```

## IR Learning

Capture from a remote:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/capture" -Method Post -Body @{
  timeout = "8"
}
```

Test a learned signal before saving:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/ir-test-learned" -Method Post -Body @{
  deviceId = "<device-id>"
  name     = "PowerToggle"
  mode     = "raw"
  raw      = "F9470P20D0S1068..."
}
```

## Bluetooth HID

Make the hub discoverable and pairable as a keyboard:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-call" -Method Post -Body @{
  action = "pairing_on"
  type   = "btkeyboard"
  name   = "Harmony Keyboard"
}
```

Check adapter and connection state:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-call" -Method Post -Body @{
  action = "adapter_status"
}
```

Check the FIFO keyboard runtime:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-text-status"
```

Send exact text through the keyboard FIFO runtime:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-text" -Method Post -Body @{
  text = "Hello World`n"
}
```

The installer starts `/data/codex/bin/codex_bthid_keyboard` automatically and
creates `/cache/bin/bthid_keyboard` as a friendly symlink. The runtime reads
`/tmp/bthid_input`, sends exact press/release reports for ASCII text, and uses
the paired target saved by the Bluetooth controls.

Send a named key or shortcut through the low-level HID report path:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-call" -Method Post -Body @{
  action = "report"
  type   = "btkeyboard"
  code   = "ctrl+l"
}
```

Send multiple named keys. Each key is encoded as a press and release pair:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/bt-call" -Method Post -Body @{
  action = "reportseq"
  type   = "btkeyboard"
  code   = "enter`nspace`nalt+f4"
  gapMs  = "35"
}
```

## Exports

```text
GET /export/bundle
GET /export/devices
GET /export/functions
GET /export/protocols
GET /export/mqtt
GET /export/wifi
```

Exports are for backups and debugging. Do not share files containing local
network or credential material.

## Software Updates

The System page can update the local control stack from this repository. The
browser fetches `payload/bin/MANIFEST.txt` and selected `codex_*` binaries,
uploads them to the hub in chunks, then the hub verifies MD5 hashes from the
manifest before installing.

Low-level SSH/dropbear files are intentionally not updated by the web UI.

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod "http://<hub-ip>:8080/api/update-status"
```

The chunked update endpoints are:

```text
POST /api/update-begin
POST /api/update-chunk
POST /api/update-apply
```

The default public GitHub repository is read through GitHub's Contents API and
works without a token. For a private GitHub repo or fork, paste a GitHub token
into the System page update field. It is used only by the browser to read GitHub
and is not sent to or stored on the hub. Change the raw base URL only when using
a public mirror.
